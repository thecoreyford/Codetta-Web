	<h1> Tutorial 3 - Timbre </h1>

	<!-- ====================================== cee9ea -->

	<div>
		<h2> Introduction </h2>
		<center>
			<p>Timbre is the character of a notes sound, excluding their pitch.</p>
			<p>This tutorial will guide you through exploring "timbre" in Codetta.</p>
		</center>
	</div>
	<!-- ====================================== -->

	<div>
		<h2> Dynamics </h2>
		<center>
			<p> Dynamics refer to how loud or quiet notes are played. Imagine a volume control on your tv.</p>
			<p> <b>TASK: Recreate the screen shot below into Codetta. </b></p>
			<img src="https://github.com/thecoreyford/thecoreyford.github.io/blob/master/codetta/tutorials/tut3Images/picture1.png?raw=true" style="width:90%; height:90%;">

			<p> The dynamics (pink) block will set the volume of all the bars to the right of it, unless changed by another dynamic block. </p>
			<p> You can change the loudness of the dynamics by clicking on the drop down menu within the "dynamics block", and choosing one of the options. </p>

			<p> Music has alot of terms, and it can get very hard remembering the names of all of the different things, especially when they match a multiude of different symbols. </p>
			<p> To help with this you can find the "info bar" at the bottom of Codetta (shown below). </p>
			<img src="https://github.com/thecoreyford/thecoreyford.github.io/blob/master/codetta/tutorials/tut3Images/picture3.png?raw=true" style="width:90%; height:90%;">

			<p> This displays alittle bit of information everytime you do something within Codetta - so looking at it can help you figure out what a "thing" does and it's correct name.</p>
			<p> <b> TASK: By looking at the info bar, try to figure out  the correct names for the "p" and "f" symbols and what they do. </b> </p>
		</center>
		</b>
	</div>

	<!-- ====================================== -->

	<div>
		<h2> Instruments </h2>
		<center>
			<p>Another large aspect of timbre is choosing instruments. Lots of different instruments have many different charactersistics. 
			<p>Similarities and differences can be found between all of Codettas instruments.</p>
			<img src="https://github.com/thecoreyford/thecoreyford.github.io/blob/master/codetta/tutorials/tut3Images/picture4.png?raw=true" style="width:90%; height:90%;">
			<p>These can be found by going to the purple instruments tab in the toolbar.</p>
			<p>All instruments are "start blocks" and work just like the "speaker block" we have been using so far.</p>
			<p>I.e. instead of starting with the speaker block, pick an instrument to begin a stream of music.</p>
		</center>
	</div>

	<!-- ====================================== -->

	<div>
		<h2> I See The Moon </h2>
		<center>
			<p> The best way to learn about the sounds of the different instruments is to start experimenting with them. </p>
			<p> <b> TASK: Copy out the nursery rhyme "I See The Moon" below. </p>
			<p> <b> The global tempo is 120 bpm!</p>
			<p> Can you describe how each part is structured within the entire song, as you compose? </b> </p>
			<img src="https://github.com/thecoreyford/thecoreyford.github.io/blob/master/codetta/tutorials/tut3Images/picture5.png?raw=true" style="width:100%; height:100%;"> 
		</center>
	</div>

	<!-- ====================================== -->

	<div>
		<h2> Improvisation </h2>
		<center>
			<p> Now that you have copied "I See The Moon" pick an instrument of your choice. </p>
			<p> Adding up to 8 different "2/4" blocks, compose your own accompaniying melody to the peice, however, only use the notes <b> G A B D </b> and <b> E </b>.</p>
			<p> To remind yourself of the pitch of each note, look at the "info bar" the letter after "Treble = " (circled in the picture below.) </p>
